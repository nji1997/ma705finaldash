# MA705 Final Project

This repository contains files used in the MA705 dashboard project.

The final dashboard is deployed on Heroku [here](https://ma705bostonuniversities.herokuapp.com).

## Dashboard Description

This dashboard is meant to serve as a landing pad to look at NHL statistics from the 2020-21 season. There were 4 free agents who are included in individual player statistics, but not team statistics. Please feel free to look at the team or player of your choice!

### Data Sources
