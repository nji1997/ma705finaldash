#MA 705 Final Dashboard - Nick Irby
Final project for MA705: Data Science
Hello! I am a Masters of Science in Finance student at Bentley University. I am an avid watcher of professional hockey, and for my final project I decided to build a dashboard of all NHL hockey players from the NHL and their statistics from the 2020-2021 season. This dashboard only included players on teams, so free agents were not included. The data source is: https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/stats.php. There we 4 free agents: Andrew Shaw, Mikko Koivu, Par Lindholm, and Filip Chlapik.

While I am a bruins fan and enjoy looking up their team and indiviual stats, I would invite you to look at the player or team of your choice!
